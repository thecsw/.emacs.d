  "Get a list of collaborators for the past 5 years in tab-delimited form.
This is for Table 4 in the COA_template at
https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/coa/coa_template.xlsx.

ENTITY-ID is an identifier that OpenAlex can use. Used
interactively you can query and select an author.

If COA-FILE is non-nil write results to that file, otherwise save
to the clipboard. You should be able to paste the results
directly into Excel.

Results are sorted in alphaphabetical order by last name.

Caveats: OpenAlex provides the name in Firstname Initial Lastname
form. I assume this can be split on spaces, and the last word is
the last name. That is not always correct, so some manual name
fixing may be required.

The Institutions are not always reliable. I use the most recent
institution if an author is listed multiple times. Sometimes this
is empty, and sometimes an author has multiple institutions
listed.

There may be duplicates for people who have different names in
OpenAlex, e.g. missing initials, differences in spelling,
abbreviations, including having a period or not.

Your name will be included, you will need to delete this manually
in the Excel sheet.

This only gets the coauthors in publications known to OpenAlex.
Recently published papers are probably missing.
