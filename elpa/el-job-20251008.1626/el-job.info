el-job
******

Imagine you have a function you’d like to run on a long list of inputs.
You could run ‘(mapcar #'FN INPUTS)’, but that hangs Emacs until done.

   This library lets you run the same function in many subprocesses (one
per CPU core), each with their own split of the ‘INPUTS’ list, then
merge their outputs and pass it back to the current Emacs.

   In the meantime, current Emacs does not hang at all.

   Best of all, it completes _faster_ than ‘(mapcar #'FN INPUTS)’, owing
to the use of all CPU cores!

   That’s it in a nutshell.  You can look at real-world usage by
searching for "el-job" in these packages:
   • org-mem.el
     (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meedstrom/org-mem/refs/heads/main/org-mem.el)

1 Since 2.5.0
*************

Released _<2025-Oct-06>_, v2.5.0 comes with a variant library
"el-job-ng".

   I find it simpler and easier to reason about.  400 lines of code
instead of 800.

   Some differences:

   • Does _not_ ever keep a process alive
   • Does _not_ merge the subprocesses’ outputs in a bespoke way, just
     uses ‘append’.
   • Does _not_ look up ‘load-history’ to try hard to find an .eln
     variant of your libraries, instead it lets ‘require’ look up
     ‘load-path’ normally.
   • Removed argument ‘:if-busy’, you can manage this yourself with
     ‘el-job-ng-busy-p’ and ‘el-job-ng-kill’.
   • Argument ‘:funcall-per-input’ now takes a function of two (2)
     arguments, not one.
   • Argument ‘:callback’ now takes a function of one (1) argument, not
     two.
   • Added optional argument ‘:eval’.

   The design is always changing in response to my needs, so feel free
to file an issue or email!  It’s instructive to hear about other
people’s needs.

1.1 Future work
===============

I may write yet another variant.

   Something that came with experience is that it’s best to make a new
variant library for a narrow use-case, rather than complicate one
library with different code flows.  When it comes to this type of
library, you really want to keep it easy to reason about!

   Ideas as of _<2025-Oct-06>_:

File IPC
     Sending input and output by writing and reading files, instead of
     through the pipe connection.

     Theory: performance can sometimes be a lot better, with large
     inputs and outputs.  I would guess it depends a lot on the machine.

     Drawback: if the data sent is sensitive, those files probably
     should be encrypted, and that could negate any performance benefit.

Worker daemons
     Keeping subprocesses alive forever, so they are available at beck
     and call – think worker daemons.

     That’s basically implemented in "el-job-old", and partly why it got
     so hairy, but it could be remade to put this usage
     front-and-center, with a "happy path" UX.

     At this time, I do not have a demanding use-case to experiment
     with, to discover what that happy path should be, how the
     affordances should be.

     If you need this now, I recommend async.el
     (https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async).

2.1 Design rationale
====================

I wanted to shorten the round-trip as much as possible, *between the
start of an async task and having the results*.

   For example, say you have some lisp that collects completion
candidates, and you want to run it asynchronously because the lisp you
wrote isn’t always fast enough to avoid the user’s notice, but you’d
still like it to return as soon as possible.

* Emacs 30 fast-read-process-output::


File: el-job.info,  Node: Processes stay alive,  Next: Emacs 30 fast-read-process-output,  Up: Design rationale

2.1.1 Processes stay alive
--------------------------

In the above example, a user might only delay a fraction of a second
between opening the minibuffer and beginning to type, so there’s scant
room for overhead like spinning up subprocesses that load a bunch of
libraries before getting to work.

   Thus, el-job keeps idle subprocesses for up to 30 seconds after a job
finishes, awaiting more input.

   An aesthetic drawback is cluttering your task manager with many
processes named "emacs".

   Users who tend to run system commands such as ‘pkill emacs’ may find
that the command occasionally "does not work", because it actually
killed an el-job subprocess, instead of the Emacs they see on screen.

2.1.2 Emacs 30 ‘fast-read-process-output’
-----------------------------------------

Some other libraries, like the popular async.el
(https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/), are designed around a custom
process filter.

   Since Emacs 30, it’s a good idea to instead use the _built-in_
process filter when performance is critical, and el-job does so.
Quoting NEWS.30
(https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.30):

     ** The default process filter was rewritten in native code.
     The round-trip through the Lisp function
     'internal-default-process-filter' is skipped when the process filter is
     the default one.  It is reimplemented in native code, reducing GC churn.
     To undo this change, set 'fast-read-process-output' to nil.

2.2 News 2.4
============

   • Jobs must now have ‘:inputs’.  If ‘:inputs’ nil and there was
     nothing queued, ‘el-job-launch’ will no-op and return the symbol
     ‘inputs-were-empty’.

2.3 News 2.3
============

   • Some renames to follow Elisp convention
        • ‘el-job:timestamps’ and friends now ‘el-job-timestamps’.

2.4 News 2.1
============

   • DROP SUPPORT Emacs 28
        • It likely has not been working for a while anyway.  Maybe
          works on the v0.3 branch
          (https://github.com/meedstrom/el-job/tree/v0.3), from 0.3.26+.

   • Jobs must now have ‘:id’ (no more anonymous jobs).
   • Pruned many code paths.


File: el-job.info,  Node: News 11,  Next: News 10,  Prev: News 20,  Up: README for 248

     perform similarly well.

2.7 News 1.0
============

   • No longer keeps processes alive forever.  All jobs are kept alive
     for up to 30 seconds of disuse, then reaped.
   • Pruned many code paths.
   • Many arguments changed, and a few were removed.  Consult the
     docstring of ‘el-job-launch’ again.

2.8 Limitations
===============

  1. The return value from the ‘:funcall-per-input’ function must always
     be a list with a fixed length, where the elements are also lists.

     For example, org-mem passes ‘:funcall-per-input
     #'org-mem-parser--parse-file’ to el-job, and if you look in
     org-mem-parser.el
     (https://github.com/meedstrom/org-mem/blob/main/org-mem-parser.el)
     for the defun of ‘org-mem-parser--parse-file’, it always returns a
     list of 5 items:

          (list (if missing-file (list missing-file)) ; List of 0 or 1 item
                (if file-mtime (list file-mtime))     ; List of 0 or 1 item
                found-entries                         ; List of many items
                org-node-parser--found-links          ; List of many items
                (if problem (list problem))))         ; List of 0 or 1 item

     It may look clunky to return sub-lists of only one item, but you
     could consider it a minor expense in exchange for simpler library
     code.

  2. Some data types cannot be exchanged with the children: those whose
     printed form look like ‘#<...>’.  For example, ‘#<buffer
     notes.org>’, ‘#<obarray n=94311>’, ‘#<marker at 3102 in
     README.org>’.

     IIUC, this sort of data only has meaning within the current process
     – so even if you could send it, it would not be usable by the
     recipient anyway.

  3. For now, this library tends to be applicable only to a narrow set
     of use-cases, since you can only pass one ‘:inputs’ list which
     would tend to contain a single kind of thing, e.g.  it could be a
     list of files to visit, to be split between child processes.  In
     many potential use-cases, you’d actually want multiple input lists
     and split them differently, and that’s not supported yet.
