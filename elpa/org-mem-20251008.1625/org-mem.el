;;; Commentary:

;; A cache of metadata about the structure of all your Org files - headings,
;; links and so on.

;; Builds quickly, so that there is no need to persist data
;; across sessions.

;; Provides two independent APIs:

;;  - Emacs Lisp: regularly named accessors such as `org-mem-entry-olpath',
;;                `org-mem-link-pos', `org-mem-all-id-nodes' etc

;;  - SQL: an in-memory SQLite database that can be queried like
;;         (emacsql (org-mem-roamy-db) [:select * :from links :limit 10])

Each directory is checked recursively \(looking in subdirectories,

Exceptions:

- Subdirectories starting with underscore or dot, such as \".emacs.d\".
  To check such a directory, add its full path explicitly,
  or else rely on `org-mem-do-sync-with-org-id' as additional source.
- Subdirectories that are symlinks.
- Anything matching `org-mem-exclude'.
- Any file not ending in one of `org-mem-suffixes'.

Can be left at nil, if `org-mem-do-sync-with-org-id' is t.
Benefits of configuring this anyway:

- Awareness of files that contain no ID at all.
- React when new files appear in these directories.
  - Useful if this Emacs session is not the only program
    that may create, move or rename files.

Tip: If past misconfiguration has recorded duplicate IDs,

Main reason to configure this is to prevent counting various kinds of
\"back-up\" and \"auto-save\" files as duplicate ID locations,
especially such files appearing somewhere inside `org-mem-watch-dirs'.

You can also speed up `org-mem-reset' a bit by excluding directories
found inside `org-mem-watch-dirs' with a very large amount of files

(defun org-mem-forget-id-locations-recursively (dir)
  "Remove all references in `org-id-locations' to any files under DIR.

Note that if DIR descends from a member of `org-mem-watch-dirs',
this action may make no practical impact unless you also add DIR to
`org-mem-exclude'.
This is because with `org-mem-do-sync-with-org-id' t, they simply get
added again on next scan.

Tip: In case of unsolvable problems, eval this to thoroughly wipe
org-id-locations:
