Toggle pixel precision scrolling.

When enabled, this minor mode scrolls the display precisely using
full trackpad or modern mouse capabilities.  It correctly scrolls
past images taller than the window height.  The mode enables
`pixel-scroll-precision-mode-map', overriding that mode's scroll
command, but other mode features, including interpolated page
scrolling, still function (if enabled).

Note that `ultra-scroll' does NOT do any interpolation of scroll
wheel data, and is intended for use with mouse/trackpad hardware
on systems providing pixel-level scroll data; see
`ultra-scroll-check' to investigate what kind of scrolling data
your system and hardware provide.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Ultra-Scroll mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='ultra-scroll-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.
