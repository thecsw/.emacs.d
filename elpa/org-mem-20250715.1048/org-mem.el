;;; Commentary:

;; A cache of metadata about the structure of all your Org files - headings,
;; links and so on.

;; Builds quickly, so that there is no need to persist data
;; across sessions.

;; Provides two independent APIs:

;;  - Emacs Lisp: regularly named accessors such as `org-mem-entry-olpath',
;;                `org-mem-link-pos', `org-mem-all-id-nodes' etc

;;  - SQL: an in-memory SQLite database that can be queried like
;;         (emacsql (org-mem-roamy-db) [:select * :from links :limit 10])

Benefits of configuring it anyway:

- Awareness of files that contain no ID at all.

Main reason to configure this is to prevent counting back-ups

You can also speed up `org-mem-reset' a bit by excluding directories
