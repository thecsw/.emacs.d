This is the local Tramp repository, branch externals/tramp. It has two
remotes, "origin" and "elpa". They are pulled/pushed like this:

# git pull origin
# git push origin

# git pull elpa externals/tramp
# git push elpa externals/tramp

These commands do not apply to the local ELPA repository. This uses
"git pull; make externals" for a pull; a push for the Tramp part is
not expected.
