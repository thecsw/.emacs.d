;;; Commentary:

;; A cache of metadata about the structure of all your Org files - headings,
;; links and so on.

;; Builds quickly, so that there is no need to persist data
;; across sessions.

;; Provides two independent APIs:

;;  - Emacs Lisp: regularly named accessors such as `org-mem-entry-olpath',
;;                `org-mem-link-pos', `org-mem-all-id-nodes' etc

;;  - SQL: an in-memory SQLite database that can be queried like
;;         (emacsql (org-mem-roamy-db) [:select * :from links :limit 10])

;; REVIEW: I wonder if it may be worth making `org-mem-entry-text' into a
;; function that actually does `insert-file-contents' in a hidden buffer, then
;; keeps one such buffer alive for every file accessed so far.  Because slow
;; resets run counter to the package's philosophy.
;; FWIW, this only makes the reset so slow because interprocess communication
;; implies the child must do `prin1' on the whole text string before sending
;; it to the parent.  If it could send a raw string, it'd probably be fast.
;; Come to think, since the parent process is doing nothing while the children
;; are working, perhaps it could get the texts itself.
;; Into an "org-mem--file<>content" table, at least, not bothering to carve
;; them up by entry until later.
