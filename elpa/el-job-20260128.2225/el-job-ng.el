  "Use asynchronous subprocesses to map FUNCALL-PER-INPUT to INPUTS.

At a glance:

1. Split INPUTS into sub-lists up to `el-job-ng-max-cores', and spawn an
   Emacs subprocess for each.

2. In each subprocess, set INJECT-VARS, load REQUIRE, eval EVAL, then
   loop over its sub-list of INPUTS, calling FUNCALL-PER-INPUT
   on each item and collecting the return values.

3. When all processes finish, append the lists of return values and pass
   that to CALLBACK, a function called precisely once.
   In other words, CALLBACK should be expected to receive one list that
   is equal in length to INPUTS.
   Also, the order of values is preserved.

Details:
- INJECT-VARS is an alist of symbols and values to pass to `set'.
  It has some default members, including `load-path'.
- REQUIRE is a list of symbols for `require', or strings for `load'.
- EVAL is a list of quoted forms.
- FUNCALL-PER-INPUT must be a symbol with a function definition,
  not an anonymous lambda.
  That definition must be discoverable via `load-path' or REQUIRE.
  It is passed two arguments: the current item, and the remaining items.
  \(You probably will not need the second argument.\)

Finally, ID is an optional symbol.  Passing an ID has two effects:
- Automatically cancel a running job with the same ID, before starting.
- Use benchmarks from previous runs to better balance the INPUTS split.
  See `el-job-ng--split-optimally'.

ID can also be passed to these helpers:
- `el-job-ng-get-job'
- `el-job-ng-await'
- `el-job-ng-await-or-die'
- `el-job-ng-ready-p'
