# show-font for GNU Emacs

This package lets you preview a font inside of Emacs. It does so in
three ways:

- Prompt for a font on the system and display it in a buffer.
- List all known fonts in a buffer, with a short preview for each.
- Provide a major mode to preview a font whose file is among the
  installed ones.
