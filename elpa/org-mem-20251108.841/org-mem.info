Org-mem
*******

A cache of metadata about the contents of all your Org files – headings,
links, timestamps and so on.

   Builds quickly, so that there is no need to persist data across
sessions.  My ‘M-x org-mem-reset’:

     Org-mem saw 2418 files, 8388 headings, 8624 links (3418 IDs, 4874 ID-links) in 1.95s

   This library came from asking myself "what could I move out of
org-node (https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node), that’d make sense in
core?"  Maybe a proposal for upstream, or at least a proof-of-concept.

   Many notetaking packages now reinvent the wheel, when it comes to
keeping track of some or many files and what may be in them.

   Example: org-roam’s DB, org-node’s hash tables, and other packages
just re-run grep all the time, which still leads to writing elisp to
cross-reference the results.

   And they must do this, because Org ships no tool to query across lots
of files.

   Well—Org does ship the agenda.  But you know what happens if you put
2,000 files into ‘org-agenda-files’!  It needs to open each file in
real-time to check anything in them, so everyday commands grind to a
halt, or even crash: many OSes have a cap of 1,024 simultaneous file
handles.

Example setup:

     (setq org-mem-watch-dirs '("~/org/" "/mnt/stuff/notes/"))
     (setq org-mem-do-sync-with-org-id t)
     (org-mem-updater-mode)

   That’s it – give it a couple of seconds, and now evalling
‘(org-mem-all-entries)’, ‘(org-mem-all-links)’ and variants should
return a lot of results.  See examples of how to use them at section
Elisp API (https://github.com/meedstrom/org-mem#elisp-api)!

   The above example checks all files in ‘org-mem-watch-dirs’
recursively, as well as files mentioned in ‘org-id-locations’ and
‘org-id-extra-files’.

2 Two APIs
**********

You get two different APIs to pick from, to access the same data.

   • Emacs Lisp
   • SQL

   Why two?  It’s free.  When the data has been gathered anyway, there
is no reason to _only_ insert it into a SQLite db, nor _only_ put it in
a hash table.

   Famously, org-roam uses a SQLite DB.  My package org-node used simple
hash tables.  Now you get both, without having to install either.


File: org-mem.info,  Node: Data only,  Next: No Org at init,  Prev: Two APIs,  Up: Top

3 Data only
***********

A design choice: Org-mem *only* delivers data.  It could easily ship
conveniences like, let’s call it a function "org-mem-goto":

     (defun org-mem-goto (entry)
       (cl-assert (org-mem-entry-p entry))
       (find-file (org-mem-entry-file entry))
       (goto-char (org-mem-entry-pos entry))

   but in my experience, that will spiral into dozens of lines over
time, to handle a variety of edge cases.  Since you may prefer to handle
edge cases different than I do, or have different needs, it ceases to be
universally applicable.

   So, it is up to you to write your own "goto" function, and all else
to do with user interaction.


File: org-mem.info,  Node: No Org at init,  Next: A SQLite database, for free,  Prev: Data only,  Up: Top

4 No Org at init
****************

A design choice: Org-mem does not use Org code to analyze your files,
but a custom, more dumb parser
(https://github.com/meedstrom/org-mem/blob/main/org-mem-parser.el).
That’s for three reasons:

  1. *Fast init*.  Since I want Emacs init to be fast, it’s not allowed
     to load Org.  Yet, I want to be able to use a command like
     ‘org-node-find’ to browse my Org stuff immediately after init.

     Or be warned about a deadline even if I don’t.

     That means the data must exist before Org has loaded.

  2. *Robustness.*  Many users heavily customize Org, so no surprise
     that it sometimes breaks.  In my experience, it’s very nice then to
     have an alternative way to browse, that does not depend on a
     functional Org setup.

  3. *Fast rebuild.*  As they say, there are two hard things in computer
     science: cache invalidation and naming things.

     Org-mem must update its cache as the user saves, renames and
     deletes files.  Not difficult, until you realize that files and
     directory listings may change due to a Git operation, OS file
     operations, a ‘mv’ or ‘cp -a’ command on the terminal, edits by
     another Emacs instance, or remote edits by Logseq.

     A robust approach to cache invalidation is to avoid trying: ensure
     that a full rebuild is fast enough that you can just do _that_
     instead.

     In fact, ‘org-mem-updater-mode’ does a bit of both, because it is
     still important that saving a file does not lag; it does its best
     to update only the necessary tables on save, and an idle timer
     triggers a full reset every now and then.

   In the future we may also create something that fits org-sql
(https://github.com/ndwarshuis/org-sql/blob/80bea9996de7fa8bc7ff891a91cfaff91111dcd8/org-sql.el#L141)’s

5.1 Without org-roam installed
==============================

Activating the mode creates an in-memory database by default.

     (org-mem-roamy-db-mode)

   Test that it works:

     (emacsql (org-mem-roamy-db) [:select * :from files :limit 10])

5.2 With org-roam installed
===========================

You can use this to end your dependence on ‘org-roam-db-sync’.  Set the
following to let org-mem overwrite the "org-roam.db" file.

     (setq org-roam-db-update-on-save nil)
     (setq org-mem-roamy-do-overwrite-real-db t)
     (org-mem-roamy-db-mode)

   Now, you have a new, all-fake org-roam.db!  Test that org-roam’s
‘org-roam-db-query’ works:

     (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from files :limit 10])

   If it works, then various packages that depend on org-roam’s DB
should also work without issue.

   N/B: because ‘(equal (org-roam-db) (org-mem-roamy-db))’, the above is
equivalent to these expressions:

     (emacsql (org-roam-db) [:select * :from files :limit 10])
     (emacsql (org-mem-roamy-db) [:select * :from files :limit 10])

   A known issue when when you run multiple Emacs instances: "attempt to
write a readonly database".  Get unstuck with ‘M-:
(org-roam-db--close-all)’.

6.1 Example: Let org-agenda cast its net wide
=============================================

You can’t put 2,000 files in ‘org-agenda-files’, but most contain
nothing of interest for the agenda anyway, right?

   Turns out I have only about 30 files worth checking, the challenge
was always knowing _which_ files ahead-of-time.  Now it’s easy:

     (defun my-set-agenda-files (&rest _)
       (setq org-agenda-files
             (cl-loop
              for file in (org-mem-all-files)
              unless (string-search "archive" file)
              when (seq-find (lambda (entry)
                               (or (org-mem-entry-active-timestamps entry)
                                   (org-mem-entry-todo-state entry)
                                   (org-mem-entry-scheduled entry)
                                   (org-mem-entry-deadline entry)))
                             (org-mem-entries-in file))
              collect file)))
     (add-hook 'org-mem-post-full-scan-functions #'my-set-agenda-files)

     (org-mem-updater-mode)


File: org-mem.info,  Node: Example Warn about dangling clocks at init,  Next: Entries and links,  Prev: Example Let org-agenda cast its net wide,  Up: Elisp API

6.2 Example: Warn about dangling clocks at init
===============================================

While Org can warn about dangling clocks through the ‘org-clock-persist’
setting, that requires loading Org at some point during your session.
Which means that if it is a matter of concern for you to forget you had
a clock going, that you effectively have to put ‘(require 'org)’ in your
initfiles, _just in case_.

   Now the following is an alternative:

     (defun my-warn-dangling-clock (&rest _)
       (let ((not-clocked-out (org-mem-all-entries-with-dangling-clock)))
         (when not-clocked-out
           (warn "Didn't clock out in files: %S"
                 (delete-dups (mapcar #'org-mem-entry-file not-clocked-out))))))
     (add-hook 'org-mem-initial-scan-hook #'my-warn-dangling-clock)

     (org-mem-updater-mode)

6.3 Entries and links
=====================

We use two types of objects to help represent file contents:
‘org-mem-entry’ objects and ‘org-mem-link’ objects.  They involve some
simplifications:

   • An ‘org-mem-link’ object corresponds either to a proper Org link,
     or to a citation fragment.
        • Check which it is with ‘org-mem-link-citation-p’.

   • The content before the first heading also counts as an "entry",
     with heading level zero.
        • Some predictable differences from normal entries: the
          zeroth-level entry obviously cannot have a TODO state, so
          ‘org-mem-entry-todo-state’ always returns nil, and so on.
        • Check with ‘org-mem-entry-subtree-p’.
             • Or if you’re looking at the list of entries output by
               ‘(org-mem-entries-in-file FILE)’, the first element (the
               ‘car’) is always a zeroth-level entry.  The rest (the
               ‘cdr’) are subtrees.
        • If the zeroth-level entry is absolutely empty, such that the
          first proper Org heading is on line 1, then
          ‘(org-mem-entry-at-lnum-in-file 1 FILE)’ returns the entry for
          that heading instead of the zeroth-level entry.  That is
          hopefully intuitive.  Opinions on API design are very welcome!

File: org-mem.info,  Node: Encrypted files (orggpg orgage),  Up: Tips

7.1 Encrypted files (‘.org.gpg’ ‘.org.age’)
===========================================

Suppose you use age.el (https://github.com/anticomputer/age.el) to keep
files encrypted.

   This needs extra config to tell org-mem’s subprocesses how to open
them.  The following should do the trick:

     (load "~/.emacs.d/my-org-mem-extra.el") ;; a file that contains "(age-file-enable)"
     (setq org-mem-load-features '(age my-org-mem-extra))
     (setq org-mem-inject-vars '(age-default-identity age-default-recipient age-program))
     (add-to-list 'org-mem-suffixes ".org.age")

   where file "~/.emacs.d/my-org-mem-extra.el" contains the following.
Sorry it’s a bit roundabout, but that’s the API for now.

     ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
     (require 'age)
     (age-file-enable)
     (provide 'my-org-mem-extra)

Files over TRAMP are excluded from org-mem’s database, so as far as
org-mem is concerned, it is as if they do not exist.

   (However, org-mem is also careful not to scrub them from your
‘org-id-locations’, so your ID-links should still work.)

   This limitation comes from the fact that org-mem parses your files in
many parallel subprocesses that do not inherit your TRAMP setup.  It is
