;;; Commentary:

;; A cache of metadata about the structure of all your Org files - headings,
;; links and so on.

;; Builds quickly, so that there is no need to persist data
;; across sessions.

;; Provides two independent APIs:

;;  - Emacs Lisp: regularly named accessors such as `org-mem-entry-olpath',
;;                `org-mem-link-pos', `org-mem-all-id-nodes' etc

;;  - SQL: an in-memory SQLite database that can be queried like
;;         (emacsql (org-mem-roamy-db) [:select * :from links :limit 10])

;;; Code:

;;; Optional: Roam aliases and refs

;; This used to come with `org-mem-roamy-db-mode', but bundling it here:
;; - allows a nicer namespace.
;; - frees Org-node users from needing to enable that mode at all.

;; Despite their names, properties ROAM_ALIASES and ROAM_REFS are not
;; only used by Org-roam, but can be seen as an emerging standard concept.
;; They need special handling because:

;; 1. These properties' values should be transformed from string to list via
;;    bespoke methods, not the generic `org-entry-get-multivalued-property'.
;; 2. The refs and aliases fished out of above lists should be cached, because
;;    they may be consulted a lot (just like vanilla IDs and titles), and it
;;    lets us check for collisions.
